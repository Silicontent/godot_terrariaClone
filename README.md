# Terraria Clone
This repo contains my Godot project files for a clone of Terraria. This is meant to be a project that gets me more practice with Godot, and is NOT meant to be
a bootleg of Terraria released for profit. All of the rights of Terraria belong to Re-Logic.

This project is under the MIT license, and you can use any of my source code for whatever you want.
