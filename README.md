# Terraria Clone
This repo contains my Godot project files for a clone of Terraria. This is meant to be a project that gets me more practice with Godot, and is NOT meant to be
a bootleg of Terraria released for profit. All of the rights of Terraria belong to Re-Logic.

I originally started this project by following this excellent tutorial from Rungeon on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0dL-9Pj2DI&t=621s

This project is under the MIT license, and you can use any of my source code for whatever you want.
